 HOW TO TRANSFER IMAGES FROM IPHONE TO RASPBERRY PI
==================================================

🔹 BEFORE YOU START (only do this once)
---------------------------------------
1. Make sure your Pi is turned on and connected to the same Wi-Fi as your iPhone.
2. Verify the Samba server is running:
      sudo systemctl status smbd
   If it’s not active, start it:
      sudo systemctl start smbd
3. Check your Pi’s IP address:
      hostname -I
   Example result: 192.168.50.123
4. Confirm your Samba user exists and is enabled:
      sudo smbpasswd -a lukasfenkam
      sudo smbpasswd -e lukasfenkam
5. Confirm that the images folder exists:
      ls /srv/images
   (If missing, create it with:
      sudo mkdir -p /srv/images
      sudo chown -R lukasfenkam:lukasfenkam /srv/images
      sudo chmod -R 2775 /srv/images )

----------------------------------------------------
🔹 EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO TRANSFER IMAGES (iPhone)
----------------------------------------------------
1. On iPhone → open the **Files** app.
2. Tap **Browse** → “…” (top right) → **Connect to Server**.
3. Enter your Pi’s address:
      smb://<your-pi-ip>/images
   Example:
      smb://192.168.50.123/images
4. Tap **Connect**.
5. Choose **Registered User** (not Guest).
6. Username:  lukasfenkam
   Password:  (your Samba password)
7. After it connects, you’ll see the “images” folder.
8. To upload photos:
      - Open **Photos** app.
      - Select pictures → tap **Share** → **Save to Files**.
      - Choose your Pi server → `images` → **Save**.
9. Wait until the upload finishes.
10. You can now open **Files → RaspberryPi → images**
    to view or delete the uploaded photos.

----------------------------------------------------
🔹 TO VERIFY UPLOADS ON THE PI
----------------------------------------------------
1. On the Pi terminal:
      ls -lh /srv/images
2. You should see the new files.
3. Optional: open them (desktop mode):
      xdg-open /srv/images
   or list them in a web browser:
      cd /srv/images
      python3 -m http.server 8080
   Then on your phone → open
      http://<your-pi-ip>:8080

----------------------------------------------------
🔹 TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------------------
❌ Can't upload / read-only:
   → Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and make sure:
        guest ok = no
        read only = no
   → Restart Samba:
        sudo systemctl restart smbd

❌ iPhone asks for password every time:
   → In Files app, tap "…" → Edit → enable "Connect Automatically".

❌ Wrong IP or can’t find server:
   → Run hostname -I again and reconnect using the new IP.
